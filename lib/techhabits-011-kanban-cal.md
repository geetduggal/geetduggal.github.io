Lately I’ve been thinking more about how I use my calendar.

I use it not just to schedule things, but to reflect how I actually work.

This little  [PR to the Obsidian Kanban plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/pull/1140)  fits squarely into that idea. It adds a small but really helpful tweak: you can copy a Kanban card to your Full Calendar. It creates an all-day event on the current day and calendar of your choice. The description matches that of the Kanban card. That’s it.

The word ‘duplicate’ or ‘copy’ is important.

Most projects (and even smaller obligations aren’t one-and-done). They show up again and again, sometimes as quick bursts, sometimes as deep work blocks. Duplicating keeps both views in sync — your kanban for tracking, your calendar for rhythm.

This approach also plays nicely with recurring but not rigid events. eg. weekly tasks like pumping the bike tires or checking your credit card purchases. This flow lets me drag cards in as calendar “themes” for parts of my day without the rigidity of defining recurring events.

I wrote about how I think about this more holistically in a [recent longer article](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/have-you-been-using-your-calendar-all-wrong-9e686de42237). In it, I describe how your calendar should feel more like a journal than a to-do list, but it also should serve as inspiration for planning: a place to see the  _shape_  of your week, not just the interruptions. Being able to echo your kanban lists onto the calendar like this helps close that loop. And it’s one more reason I’m glad both plugins are in my daily stack.

In the article I mentioned AI tools may motivate me to do this more quickly. A few years ago, I would have probably put off doing something like this due to the overhead of writing a bunch of boilerplate code, but with AI coding tools I was able to make the integration in less than a half-hour and test it in an hour or so on Desktop and mobile.

I’ll be trying this out more in the coming weeks and it’s been fun to use so far! If you have any thoughts or ideas, excited to chat! ‘Till next time 🏔️
