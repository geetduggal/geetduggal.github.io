🎄 While some of my longer articles describe a few of my most precious digital habits in detail, there are a few habits I mentioned only briefly or those that I haven’t mentioned at all that I’d like to briefly (re-)surface here as we enter into 2026.

All of these habits are ones that I perform most every day and are ones connected deeply with my digital life. Perhaps one or more will resonate with you :-)

## 1. Keep a One-App Home Screen

My home screen currently looks like what you see above: just a simple wallpaper with one app. I decided that if I take the time to look at my screen, I’d like to be intentionally guided into just one place I think is a good default to visit.

For me, it’s Obsidian. Obsidian gives me access to my personal calendar, notes, and lists to help me decide what’s the most exciting and beneficial thing I can focus on now.

Phones make it so easy these days to quickly access any app. Therefore, not placing any other app on my home screen isn’t a huge loss. In fact, the little extra friction to access other apps: Slack, Maps, Phone, YouTube, etc is very welcome since I’m less likely to be distracted.

## 2. Feed a ‘Re-Read List’

More often than not these days, I’ve been revisiting certain books, movies, and articles I’ve enjoyed way back in the past. I’m always surprised at how much I forget. I am simultaneously grateful for why I remembered to re-read them in the first place. I decided this year to be a little more intentional about re-reading and now keep ‘re-read’ lists: books, podcasts, articles, etc. that I would like to read again because they resonated with me so much.

When re-reading, I often decide to take notes or pursue the reading in a bit more of an ‘active learning’ fashion. I find creating these lists particularly useful for new content I come across. I feel little pressure to take notes or highlight on first consumption. All I care about is enjoying what I’m consuming in the moment. If it moves me, it goes on the list and I can trust I’ll revisit it sometime later if I want to dig deeper.

I currently use two primary apps to feed my re-read list: Audible and Readwise. Because of an issue with my eyesight, audiobooks are the best way for me to consume books and I love the audio integration on Readwise. Readwise is a single source for me save notes from Kindle, Articles, Podcasts, Youtube Videos. If I listen to something on either Audible or Readwise and it resonates, I put it on my re-read list and these apps make it easy to dig deeper when I want to again.

## 3. Use your Voice to Take Notes and Journal

I often find it easiest to make progress on abstract topics while I walk. This ‘walk-and-talk’ model provides a rhythm to my thinking that always seems to result in a satisfying concrete end result both physically and mentally.

There are two types of ‘walk-and-talk’ habits I perform daily:

1.  Take notes using voice-assisted AI. I prefer Claude these days, but any app with a good voice mode can help you research topics on-the-go. I am always surprised at how much I can learn and how much progress I can make this way.
2.  Voice journal using a simple voice memo app. I’ve been using Apple’s ‘Voice Memos’ app for ages. While I’ve tried others and I like them (eg. Otter.ai), this app is free and supports long-form recording on my phone, Mac, and watch. The thing I like most about voice journaling is the ability to reflect on my day  [interstitially](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/this-simple-journaling-method-could-change-your-life-638b51fac9d8)  (that is, between events). Of all my digital habits, this one centers me the most and brings me the greatest peace and energy moving forward.

At the end of my recording or note taking, I will often process my thinking using AI tools and transcript as a note in a  [notable folder](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/this-one-idea-changed-the-way-i-organized-my-notes-forever-f293371a0d5b).

## 4. Keep a Plain Text Plan

, I consider myself a #PlainTextPlanner. What does this mean? For me, it means that no matter how many other digital or non-digital calendars are in my life, at the end of the day, I do all my planning in my own pocket digital planner.

It’s in plain text. This gives me the feeling that the plan is _mine, portable, and feels like the digital equivalent of paper._

These days, I prefer the  [Full Calendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)  plugin in Obsidian because I like to visually plan my days, weeks, and months, but the exact format doesn’t really matter.

As a corrolary to this, I often find it very useful to set my intent for the day in the form of an all-day event.

I may write more about this in the future, but I can’t overstate the power and peace of mind that comes from deliberately creating my own plan, rather than having one handed to me by people or apps.

## 5. Keep Your Phone In The Kitchen

I have Cal Newport to thank for this. I didn’t really jump at the suggestion when I first heard it, but one day I needed to move my charger to make space for another device and I just moved it to the kitchen.

Now, since my phone is often there, I find myself less distracted. I like the fact that I’m not disconnected but do have to walk with intent to do most things on the phone. And as a plus, my phone stays charged!

## 6. Sculpt Digital Thoughts into Analog Truths

When I think about analog mediums: raw voice recordings, notes on a piece of paper, etc, I tend to think of capturing information in its rawest form or reading it in some final printed form.

Lately, I have found that after a lot of raw thoughts get curated and refined through my digital workflow, I like to open up  [my Bujo](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/atlas-journaling-a-unified-approach-for-seeing-the-big-picture-and-acting-with-focus-78804f26f5ab)  and write down conclusions, truths, and information I’d like to more deeply connect with. Physical writing and audio/video recording is one of the best ways to do that IMHO.

This approach avoids the ‘staring at a blank page’ problem since I already have something I want to write about. It also addresses an issue I think many of us have with notebooks: we don’t want to ruin them with our messy chicken scratch. If the content going into them is already refined then it’s more a matter of transcription than invention.

## 7. ‘Tidy Up’ My Digital Space

Every evening, I spend time to tidy up our home and it gives me great satisfaction. It’s sometimes hard and even necessary but the end result is always pleasing.

Over the past year, I’ve focused on creating a digital workflow that feels rewarding to maintain. The goal: making my digital space somewhere I actually look forward to organizing, with the same satisfaction I get from tidying a physical space.

What this usually means is that I’ve:

1.  Processed my main Inbox to a reasonable degree of satisfaction. Generally, I keep things there that I still want to be reminded of on approximately a weekly timescale and I sort the rest
2.  Briefly looked at my active projects, lists, and spaces to see if there’s anything actionable
3.  Ensured there’s at least a rough plan for the next day

Like with physical tidying-up, digital tidying-up doesn’t have to be perfect and it’s usually pretty quick to do. I seem to have an informal standard of care I hold myself to and that’s enough to keep my space tolerable to live in and just messy enough to be cozy and inspiring.

Happy holidays and best wishes as you enter 2026! ‘Till next time 🏔️
