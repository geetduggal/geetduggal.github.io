It’s been a while since I last posted, but rest assured there will be more coming soon! As the holiday season approaches, I’ll be sharing some thoughts that have been in the works for a few months now. But until then, I wanted to give a brief update on where my mind is at when it comes to the tools I use.

### Kanban Plus Plugin Status

My  [last post](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/introducing-the-obsidian-kanban-plus-plugin-3c970c21141a)  was about an Obsidian plugin that I announced in a sort of “pre-release” fashion. You can think of it as an enhanced version of the Obsidian Kanban plugin, with quite a few new features for managing lists within one file and across files. It also integrates with the particularly handy Full Calendar plugin.

In that article, I mentioned that I planned to imminently release the plugin for review. But after I posted, I decided I wanted to let the plugin bake for a bit longer. I sometimes like to play devil’s advocate on the tools and methods I’m using to see if there’s something simpler or better, though I also want to be mindful of not spending too much time on that. I’ve  [written in the past](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/tech-habits-capture-everything-in-one-place-dd3f20fee466)that I’m not usually too worried about this because the time I spend thinking about these tools is usually a small fraction of the time I spend doing my overall work.

That being said, I took the functionality that this new plugin provides — which I’ve been enjoying for a number of months now — and I wanted to systematically compare it against a few other alternatives, at least on paper. These are alternatives provided by apps that you could just use out of the box: for example, going all-in on the Apple ecosystem (which has an interesting experiment going on right now), the Google ecosystem, Todoist, Amplenote, or using Notion.

I wasn’t planning on jumping ship to any of those, but I wanted to really take a deeper look and see what those ecosystems provide that maybe this plugin and my current setup does not.

I’ll spare this post the minutiae of that investigation, but long story short: I do feel that the ecosystems themselves provide a level of integration as well as a smaller learning curve to apply essentially the same principles that I use in the Kanban Plus plugin. So if you’re interested in how this workflow could look in other systems, please chime in.

But the interesting thing I found was that even with all of the conveniences provided by going all-in on an Apple ecosystem, Google ecosystem, or an all-in-one tool like Notion, none of it really outweighed the benefits I get from a plain text approach.

In short, I feel the plain text approach is a lot faster and more flexible. It’s surprisingly quick to simply capture my thoughts, edit them, and run whatever kinds of tools I really want, and do it in a way that feels very smooth and efficient for the most part. And when you add the feeling of portability on top of efficiency and flexibility, plus the occasional ability to customize, I feel that much more confident about the value that something like the Kanban Plus plugin can provide myself and potentially others, even if it’s just one other person!

The plugin has been officially submitted for review. We’ll see what happens there. Again, I’m not looking to compete with or replace the original Kanban plugin, but since the original plugin has been a bit out of development, and for many reasons I described in the last post, I like the idea that I can iterate on this new plugin with a few principles that are under my control.

So I just wanted to give a brief update that hopefully it’ll become an official plugin soon, and I look forward to continuing to work on it. There are actually quite a few new ideas that I have for features that should be relatively simple to implement with a little bit of help from AI tooling. It maybe just needs a little more thought and a few hours of work and testing. For example, I’m thinking about the ability to move entire lists between files, to be able to move cards between lists across files in a more flexible and ad hoc way by auto-completing the file name that you want to move them to (as well as the list), as well as duplicating or making copies of items in lists.

Looking forward to providing more updates on this front, and thank you for humoring me in this fun little experiment that’s actually been going strong for many months now. I’ve really been enjoying it!

### Double-Downing on a Unified Naming Scheme

From a broader workflow perspective, I’ve also been doing a lot of thinking, particularly about the reasons why we take notes in the first place, the best flow for capturing what resonates with me and then turning them into artifacts that are meaningful for me and others, and what kind of notes stand the test of time. More on that in a subsequent post.

But I did want to mention one thing very briefly. As mentioned above, I’ve been doubling down on my plain text setup, but I want to be clear that I do like to think of that as a part of a much broader workflow that does involve other apps. It’s not like I’m doing  _everything_  in plain text and in Obsidian. In fact, as mentioned above, part of the benefit of doing things in plain text is that I can use other apps. And that also means my entire workflow is not limited to one app. That simply isn’t practical and doesn’t make sense.

For example, Google Sheets is very useful for budgeting purposes, or a specific project management tool I use at work should be used in that environment. But what really matters is the interfaces between these tools and how you use them in a broader context.

The common thread is that the best way you can work with multiple apps simultaneously but keep a clean picture is by using a unified naming system. If you’re working on a project or you’re working on a particular kind of task, the little extra effort it takes to think about giving that work a name goes a long way. No matter what application you’re using, you can use that name, and then it makes it really easy to subsequently search for it. Crucially, it makes it easy for your mind to contextualize it.

### Urgent Reminders

Aside from typical office apps or project management apps that you might use in a work context, there’s one other class of apps I feel are legitimately powerful and better left outside of the plain text productivity suite I’ve built for myself: really small tasks or reminders.

This usually has to do with tasks that are very dependent on time to get done logistically or urgently. Usually what I’ve done — and I’ve mentioned this in the past — is I set alarms for myself, and it’s kind of a clunky system. What ends up working well most of the time is just asking my Apple Watch to remind me or set an alarm. For someone like me, when there’s a lot of things going on, a simple notification reminder isn’t good enough, which is why I never really bought myself 100% into using a tool like Reminders. I just would rather rely on my phone’s or my watch’s alarm functionality for things that really needed to get done at or by a specific time.

I did want to mention that in iOS 18.2, I’m pretty excited about a new feature coming:  [alarms for reminders](https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-alarms-and-timers-in-reminders/). If you mark a certain reminder as urgent and you have it scheduled for a certain time, it will trigger an alarm. And I think this is low-key a massive improvement, at least for myself and maybe for other people. If your work or personal life is anything like mine: busy with a lot of interruptions, this will make sure that you are reminded, and will be repeatedly until you really decide to stop the alarm.

Finally, here are a few posts and other thoughts that have been really interesting to me lately, and I’ll leave you with them. I’ll post something more meaty very soon.

The last four videos released by Ryder Carrol on his Bullet Journal channel are excellent. I think some of his work is the most thoughtful out there and I appreciate the plain text vibe:

Tiago Forte has a couple of interesting posts in text and on YouTube essentially explaining why, much to his surprise, AI isn’t really an extinction event PARA or other principles of ‘Building a Second Brain’. I would say I really do agree as much as I want to play Devil’s Advocate here.

Nick Milo has a nice YouTube video on what he calls ‘AI Zones’ which really resonates with my view on using AI. It’s important to have a clear separation from your ‘own’ sculpting vs the material and inspiration you use.
