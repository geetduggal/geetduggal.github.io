## Implemented Three Ways: Paper (Bullet Journal), Kanban (Obsidian), or Calendar (Reminders + Apple Calendar)

I am a  [time blocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeblocking).
I use a system I call the ‚Äò[Frontier method](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/discipline-absorbs-chaos-try-this-game-changing-simple-way-to-manage-your-time-14e262ca05bc)‚Äô where I keep two calendars of events:

**_Sacred_**: Events I treat with the same priority as a job interview or doctor‚Äôs appointment. I will attend, no matter what.

**_Frontier_**: Events I  _intend_  to attend, roughly around this time. These are flexible and forward-looking.

Importantly, both calendars include more than just social obligations ‚Äî I also block time for specific tasks, whether personal or professional.

In this post, I‚Äôll explain how I use two core lists to guide my time blocks each day:

**_Projects_**_:_ These are the meaningful, memorable efforts I hope to complete over the coming weeks or months. They represent the ‚Äúbig rocks‚Äù in my day ‚Äî work that moves the needle and feels worth doing.

**_Obligations_**_:_  These are the smaller, often necessary tasks. Theya re administrative items, background maintenance, and service work. They‚Äôre what keep my ship well-oiled: essential for smoothness & stability, but not necessarily the reason I set sail.

Example projects:

-   Yosemite 2025: a family trip that requires a reasonable amount of preparation and is a larger time commitment
-   Important project at work
-   Hiring for a new position
-   Backyard irrigation: hoses and timer

Example obligations:

-   Submit request for parking reimbursements
-   Help someone debug an issue they are working on
-   Get new socks
-   Help to resolve key security tickets
-   Perform a code review

The distinction between big rocks and minutiae might seem obvious, but in practice, using them alongside the Frontier method has been more powerful than I expected. Keeping both lists forces me to see, with more honesty, how much of my time is spent moving the needle on meaningful work versus how much goes toward maintenance ‚Äî emails, requests, small fixes. Both matter. But without naming the types of tasks, it‚Äôs easy to blur the difference and lose track of what kind of day I‚Äôm actually having.

The real value shows up over time. By maintaining these two lists for the span of a  [season](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/atlas-journaling-a-unified-approach-for-seeing-the-big-picture-and-acting-with-focus-78804f26f5ab)  ‚Äîlets say a few months ‚Äî I can better align my intentions with reality. I get to ground what I hope to do against what I‚Äôve already committed to (my  _Sacred_ calendar), and that tension helps shape more realistic plans.

More importantly, it lets me choose how seriously to treat any given day or week. If I‚Äôm falling behind on meaningful projects, I can mark time for them as  _Sacred_  instead of  _Frontier_. I don‚Äôt have to overreact in the moment because I know the season provides breathing room ‚Äî but that same container also brings healthy pressure: if I want to finish what matters, I can‚Äôt drift forever.

Now imagine those two lists above in something like a Bullet Journal. You could structure your daily log / planning page like this:

A simple two-column approach is a convenient way to play with your day in 2D before time blocking any events. The flexibility of a ‚Äòblank page‚Äô allows you to take some more contextual notes and place some aspirational tasks for the day. This way you use your actual calendar for  _Sacred_  events only, for example.

My days tend to be pretty dynamic and I like to use a Kanban board in Obsidian that I call the ‚ÄòStaircase Kanban‚Äô:

The two core lists, Big Rocks and Minutiae, sit at the center of my system. They‚Äôre flanked by two others:  **_Idea_**  (a someday/maybe list for possible future Big Rocks) and  **_Celebrate_**  (a space to reflect on recent wins). In between sits  **_Doing_**, which anchors my focus for the current day or week.

I think of this layout as a kind of ‚Äòstaircase‚Äô, because the list sizes tend to taper from right to left. I always have far more ideas for meaningful, needle-moving projects than I have time to act on. Minutiae, or Obligations, usually outnumber the seasonal Big Rocks I actively commit to. And realistically, I can only juggle a few tasks at any one time. That‚Äôs why I maintain a ‚ÄòDoing‚Äô list with a strict WIP (work-in-progress) limit of 3. It helps me prioritize what gets time-blocked next whether it‚Äôs a major project or just an essential but small task.

More on this idea of a ‚Äòstaircase‚Äô or ‚Äòfunnel‚Äô and its variants (eg. see  [Amplenote](https://www.amplenote.com/)) in an upcoming post.

Finally, one of the simplest and most practical setups I‚Äôve found involves just using an existing task manager. I will illustrate this point using Reminders, though tools like Todoist support similar features. If you‚Äôre in the Apple ecosystem, it works seamlessly out of the box. Keep two lists (Projects and Obligations) sorted by urgency or priority. Then, literally drag and drop tasks directly into my calendar view, turning intent into scheduled time with minimal friction.

(And if you implement a ‚ÄòFrontier‚Äô time blocking method you can literally map specific reminders in Projects or Obligations to a Sacred or Frontier calendar.)

The real strength of the two-list approach is that it forces a clear distinction between the tasks that move the needle and the smaller, more routine obligations that keep everything running. That distinction matters. Without it, it‚Äôs easy to let the day fill up with busywork while more significant goals quietly stall. Yet by visually managing both lists in the same system, I stay grounded in reality. I am aware of what truly deserves my attention without ignoring the necessary upkeep. Best of all, it‚Äôs simple enough to implement with any of the three methods I just described, and I hope that this approach also resonates with you.

Looking forward to posting more and following-up on some points mentioned in previous Tech Habits posts soon!
