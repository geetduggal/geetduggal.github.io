It‚Äôs an above average day. If you‚Äôre fortunate, you glance at your calendar the night before. Your events, whether self-scheduled or created by others, lay before you. They already constrain what your day will look like. Throughout the day, your calendar acts as a guide prompting you to complete tasks and schedule future commitments.

The cycle repeats.

On tougher days, you may not have even looked at your calendar in advance. Perhaps you glanced at a couple of events. But you didn‚Äôt make time for more. You didn‚Äôt slow down and get comfortable with the events you have committed to. In the worst case, you may feel like your calendar stops serving you, and you start serving it.

On the other hand, you may consider yourself an above average manager of your time. Your time is ‚Äòblocked‚Äô ahead of time carefully for things you care about doing. You may even occasionally use separate forms of journaling or more advanced techniques to motivate what to do next. While this can appear highly productive (some even claim it doubles productivity), it can leave you feeling hollow, consumed by the ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù sensation after a fleeting sense of accomplishment.

In all these cases, I argue that your relationship with your time is stripped down to something insipid: a ‚Äòchecklist productivity‚Äô of sorts that pays no respect to the gift of time that has passed, and the complimentary gift of time which is right in front of you.

I believe that our calendars and the tools we use to edit them should inspire us, not leave us feeling drained. The fundamental problem is that we believe our calendars amount to a list of events we must attend; that the tools we use to edit them should serve us for this purpose alone and otherwise recede into the background.

This article is a challenge to myself and to you to view your calendar in a very different way. Your calendar holds your past, your future, and your potential, all in one place, across the cycles that occur through your life. Why not let that be a source of inspiration for how you use it?

Use whatever tools you like. Get creative (or not). My hope is that the following principles will help to couch this challenge in a meaningful way for you to take action. So get out the popcorn üçø, and let us go on a ride!

# Ground Yourself in Memorable Repetition

Time moves forward, like a river, but our calendars show us something else: a repeating pattern. Our days, weeks, months, and years cycle over and over.

Repetition is built into the cosmos. The planets move in cycles, and these cycles make our calendar more like a wheel of time. Even though everything changes, there‚Äôs a periodicity and rhythm underneath it all.

Stargazing aside, your day-to-day, week-to-week, and year-to-year is full of repetition. For example, you may:

-   brush your teeth every morning,
-   follow a specific routine to relax at night,
-   have multiple recurring personal and professional meetings every week,
-   visit the salon roughly every month, and
-   look forward and plan for holidays and birthdays every year.

Imagine you approach each day, week, month, or year with a deep understanding of these repeating patterns. And also, how these patterns can change.

Imagine that when you look at your calendar, you are implicitly or explicitly appreciating these repeated moments. Between these repeating moments, we figure out what new things we want to do, and what old patterns we might want to change or stop altogether.

As a related example, let‚Äôs imagine your day, week, and year in any given season of your life each as circles with recurring events along the circle.

Suppose that for any given day you have a ‚Äòmorning routine‚Äô take up roughly two hours, and same for a ‚Äòbedtime routine‚Äô. And in-between, you may notice that you really appreciate a longer one hour walk after work around 6pm.

For the week, key repeating events are within-team meetings Monday mornings and cross-team meetings Wednesday mornings. You also just recently discovered that a weekly planning session every Friday afternoon sets the best tone for the following week.

Finally, for the year, you value a few key birthdays in June, August, September, and November as well as holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and July 4th. You also make it a point to schedule yearly eye, dental, and health exams along with a regular auto maintenance appointment and personal financial review.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4212/1*8FrGXEKMlE23JZWwUZLYww.png)

Crucially, acknowledging this repetition allows us to understand more specifically and practically how much free time we actually have. Repeating themes and events provide a scaffolding on which you can view the rest of your time.

For example, I may want to swap my after-work walk mentioned above with a more challenging form of exercise. If I want to add a new event to a yearly routine, I have a more explicit idea as to whether it is realistic. I‚Äôm also better positioned to plan ahead knowing what important recurring events are coming my way.

Here are a few points supporting this principle:

-   **Keep recurring events in** [**working memory**](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/satisfy-the-beast-science-the-sh-t-out-of-difficult-tasks-and-habits-18c4e3d2f04a). You should be able to recall repeated events that ground you off the top of your head. Think about the most important needle-moving and spiritually uplifting routines across scales of time and hold them close to your heart. It‚Äôs fine if you want to actually represent these events in lists or as recurring events in a physical notebook or calendar app, but these events should truly be memorable so ideally you shouldn‚Äôt need to rely on your calendar to remind you of them.
-   **Be fearless when repeating content across events.** Recurring  events generally have content associated with them. Think preparing for birthday parties, weekly meetings, etc. The most natural way to organize content and notes related to the event is by linking it to the event directly. When an event repeats, it may be tempting to somehow unify repeated information across events. In my experience this can lead to wasted time and confusion. Simply copy and paste the relevant information. You can rely on the fact that recurring events as I‚Äôve defined them are memorable for example. If you ever want to look up details or notes from a particular meeting or Birthday celebration, you know exactly on your calendar where to look. If you want to organize this information at a higher level, do so organically.
-   **Think in terms of seasons natural to you**. In the example above I highlighted daily, weekly, and yearly scales of time. While these are the obvious cycles to use, I also like to think in terms of ‚Äòseasons‚Äô. These could be just a few weeks or on the order of a quarter or so. But they have a natural start and end point with their own rituals based on what feels right to me. In this sense, it‚Äôs important to recognize that at larger scales seasons will repeat themselves and can be often very personal in nature.

# Color Your Time

This principle is where the day-to-day magic truly occurs. When you color your calendar, you don‚Äôt look at your calendar just to see what‚Äôs next or worry if you‚Äôre ready for what‚Äôs coming. That‚Äôs the boring, uninspiring, even stressful way.

Instead, you see your past as sacred. It has already happened. As you live through the present moment, you are already adding to both your immediate past and future. This process is like a gentle form of journaling. It‚Äôs a quick, personal diary of your events tied to the exact time they happened.

You can color your past events in whatever way that feels good to you using just a few simple categories. For example, you could color them by  _activity_:

-   Reading
-   Coding
-   Entertainment
-   Administrative
-   Shopping / Errands

Or you could color them by the  _people_  involved:

-   Immediate family
-   Friends
-   Professional Colleagues

The goal is to better annotate the important moments of your past. You can see how these colored events connect, or you can focus on each category individually and appreciate it. You don‚Äôt need to account for every single minute. Just log the particularly important or memorable events, whether they happen often or just once.

I can‚Äôt stress enough how much this small shift in how you look at your calendar can change everything. Remember, ‚Äúas you live through the present moment, you are already adding to this immediate past and future, like a gentle form of journaling.‚Äù Many journaling methods already encourage this. Think Bullet Journaling or  [Interstitial Journaling](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/this-simple-journaling-method-could-change-your-life-638b51fac9d8). My suggestion is to make this kind of journaling even simpler and more powerful by doing it directly on your calendar.

The future is very different. As a variant on the more rigid idea of time blocking, this principle understands that there‚Äôs a natural flow to your work and your motivation. There‚Äôs a rhythm between focused effort and unexpected things that will challenge any strict plans.

Importantly, you want tosee your potential future in a way that‚Äôs inspired by your past. Often, just looking at the events of the last day or week gives you enough natural next steps to inspire what‚Äôs coming. But how many of us actually look at our past in this way? Some of us may keep a daily log or journal. By putting what happened in your past right into your calendar it makes the process of planning your immediate future based on your past that much more frictionless.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*nDUT_sL4H35OlMlk1eXHAQ.png)

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how this works for me:

I‚Äôve found it incredibly helpful to quickly look at what I did in project planning meetings or during deep coding sessions over the last day or two, right there in my calendar. This immediately jogs my memory about what I should do next.

I can easily pull out the most important points from those past events to use in upcoming regular meetings and make sure everyone is on the same page. It‚Äôs simple because I do it all within my calendar. And when the meeting starts, I have key notes right at my fingertips.

Looking at events from your recent past isn‚Äôt enough. Sometimes, tiny details or big ideas from further back in time are relevant to what you might want to do in the near future. Lists of these potential events can also fit into categories, maybe the same ones you use for your recent past.

It could be, eg:

-   books to read
-   movies to watch
-   home projects
-   work projects
-   small administrative tasks
-   follow-ups

However you want to contextually group your potential events, the important point is to recognize that calendars aren‚Äôt just for events; they‚Äôre inspired by lists. These lists are like paint that can be added to the canvas of your time.

Depending on your mood and what‚Äôs needed, your immediate past and these lists inspire your near future. I find that 3‚Äì7 day windows with columns as days and rows as hours are appropriate spans of time to look at to color your calendar. The days can be easily stored in your working memory and often align well with traditional weeks. In this sense you can color your week with notable events.

As a brief historical aside, it may not be commonly appreciated that the seven-day week, like the month and the year, also has astronomical origins rooted in ancient Babylonian (and even earlier) observations. They were  [likely inspired by three key patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoAJWj6XQKo&t=3s):

1.  Seven celestial bodies that seemed to move independently: the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, which they considered cosmologically significant. This led to a seven-day cycle, with each day named after one of these ‚Äòplanets‚Äô
2.  The approximate seven-day phases of the moon
3.  Noted constellations, such as the Big Dipper and the Pleiades, which contain seven prominent stars, reinforcing the importance of the number seven.

As the notion of a week spread through space and time, many cultures found interesting ways to color their calendar incorporating weeks into circular pictures of calendars as early as the ninth century and columns hinting at what we see in weekly planners today (eg. those from Christian  [Book of Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours)).

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2624/1*56q6RDy832vkLyN4UFLuww.jpeg)

It was likely not until the eighteenth century with Robert Aitkens 1773 planner that the concept of logging and  _planning_  the week with days as columns was marketed to the masses. And it was not until a century or so later that enough industrialization had occurred to popularize the concept.

This layout is now iconic. Most modern-day knowledge workers live inside the 5 or 7 day week layout, and I argue that using the principles in this article this view could be used a lot more effectively.

The principle of coloring your week conceptually combines a column-layout of days on the left-hand side, with lists on the right-hand side. Events and list items are colored by category or context.  [Additionally they are considered either ‚Äòsacred‚Äô (have already occurred in the past, will surely occur at a specified time in the future) or ‚Äòfrontier‚Äô (possibilities for the future).](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/discipline-absorbs-chaos-try-this-game-changing-simple-way-to-manage-your-time-14e262ca05bc)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4204/1*stjURk9pjvzuVMH4ucmoEA.png)

The colors of your past and the possibilities of your future come together in the light of your present and near future. The magic lies in seeing all those colors and putting them together for what you truly believe can happen.

As opposed to meticulously blocking out your present and near future, the goal is to accommodate items in your frontier in the most natural way possible. You can listen to your inner voice that tells you how to best use your time. Listen to your worries, and listen to your inspiration. Then, simply choose. The beauty is that you narrow down all these possibilities to a few things that actually become real.

I also see it as solving a little puzzle. In the past, you review pieces that have already been placed in the puzzle. You feel gratitude for what was built. And you can do this often, because it‚Äôs the same tool you use every day, just seen from a different angle ‚Äî looking backward, not forward.

In the future, your puzzle pieces are laid out ‚Äî things you could do, guided by your mood, by the situation, however you like. And in the present, some pieces are already in place, things you know you‚Äôre going to do no matter what. Your job is to find what fits. And there‚Äôs joy in solving that puzzle.

You start to realize that in a world with many possibilities, what you can actually do in the near future is actually limited. There is a huge satisfaction gained when you consciously identify something that  _feels right_  and actually fits in the present moment.

# Prioritize Portability

This concept might sound simple, but it‚Äôs very deep. To prioritize portability means that no matter how you look at your calendar, you see it as  _yours_. You can take it with you. It‚Äôs your friend.

You know where everything is stored. The only surprises are the ones you discover yourself, not those forced upon you from outside.

What does this mean? It means when you see your calendar in a way that‚Äôs truly yours, like a physical notebook you carry everywhere, it becomes your main source of truth. It‚Äôs almost the opposite of what a calendar is for most people who see their calendar as just another tool or even a distraction.

One particularly handy historical example is the traditional Norwegian primstav (used as early as the fifteenth century), or runic calendar stick.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2400/0*xwFpAlrEfXTta5C5.jpg)

Source:  [Living a Nordic Life](https://www.livinganordiclife.com/post/the-primstav-and-riskrem)

The stick helped its users to stay organized during a typical year. It has all sorts of notches and symbols to mark days, weeks, and flag important agricultural events.

Rune sticks or notebooks are natural vehicles for portable calendars in the physical realm. But in the digital world, the concept of portability is a bit more subtle. It isn‚Äôt just about the file type. It‚Äôs more about your ability, in your mind, to understand how you can gather all this information about your time and keep it with you. It‚Äôs about you understanding how and why you want to manage your time, and how that is organized in a digital space.

It could be plain text files in folders, or standard file types (think the  [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar#:~:text=The%20filename%20extension%20of%20ics,environments%20are%20iCal%20and%20iFBf.)  format). It could be all in the cloud with regular exports to standard format as a backup (think storing all your events and tasks in Google and exporting using Google Takeout). Whatever it is, you know where it lives, and you know you can take it anywhere. You have tools that let you move this information from one app to another, and you benefit from that freedom. It‚Äôs all still yours, just like that physical notebook is yours. This digital container, which might have at first seemed a bit abstract, becomes more tangible.

It is therefore best to look at ‚Äòexternally driven calendars‚Äô such as your work calendar or calendar of community events‚Äî as all contributing to this one sacred place where you play with your time. Again, this is more natural to execute when your personal source-of-truth calendar is physical. In this case you must manually copy professional meetings into your source-of-truth calendar. This takes a bit of repetition, but it helps you better untangle conflicts and prioritize bigger life events at different time scales. In the digital realm, you must have a bit more discipline to do this ‚Äòmanual copying of events‚Äô as it may be more tempting to simply include your professional calendar as one of many lists of calendars in the software of your choice.

# In Practice

The principles just discussed illustrate a variety of concrete examples of how to view your calendar as a more of an interactive playground for inspiration. I purposefully didn‚Äôt talk much about specific tools because you can follow these principles with multiple very different approaches.

Before I illustrate a few examples, I do want to briefly overview where the calendar fits into my general workflow. My data is stored in a few places:

1.  **Log: One Big Text File (OBTF)**. I use this place as a historical log of working memory to quickly capture a thought I have if it is not convenient to put it in its ‚Äòproper‚Äô place. There will often be a lot of data here and much of it may be never referenced again.
2.  **Log: Calendar & Lists**. I use this place to store exactly the kinds of events and lists discussed in this article. It‚Äôs just enough additional structure than OBTF to be useful for the majority of my data storage and referencing use cases. It is also significantly less noisy than my OBTF. I repeat or copy over relevant information from my OBTF into this Log. It is often the ‚Äòproper‚Äô place for most of my information.
3.  **Projects**. A pace to store all my larger, but time-bounded efforts typically occurring on the scale of a season. These are typically much larger projects where it is handy to have a separate container just to store information relevant to them (think remodeling part of your house). It is important to note that more relevant structured data falls into the ‚ÄòCalendar & Lists‚Äô category than this one. This is because many things we do don‚Äôt really need to have a separate container dedicated to them. This storage location is saved for very large projects needing lots of data to be all in one place. Less data moves from the Logs into this location.
4.  **Spaces.**  This location is for timeless topics. Think of them like  [your own personal Wikipedia-like articles](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/want-extraordinarily-useful-and-timeless-notes-build-a-personal-knowledge-encyclopedia-bc8b7fb09829). It‚Äôs meant to be a place of information important to you and described in your own words. Spaces are cultivated and refined over time with no well-defined endpoint.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*MZ3E7EJczMczEUUBMVCYiA.png)

You can read more about how these are all tied together in a  [broader](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/capture-to-do-d040e1bae4a6)  [system](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/atlas-journaling-a-unified-approach-for-seeing-the-big-picture-and-acting-with-focus-78804f26f5ab).

Arguably the simplest and most useful realization of these principles is completely self-contained in the Google ecosystem: combine both Google Calendar and Tasks. You can see from the screenshot below that there is already a column-based layout similar to what I mentioned in the ‚ÄòColor Your Calendar‚Äô principle where you can select between lists. To embrace recurrence you can literally create recurring events, add these types of events to lists on the right-hand-side, and/or keep them in memory.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4872/1*-eXtmnHyOc3xXmeSXlGZWw.png)

The interesting thing about this approach is that many third-party applications can draw directly from these sources. Fantastical is one great example that supports dragging and dropping tasks and/or duplicating from events. Apps like Akiflow provide a similar experience.

You can do something similar with Apple‚Äôs Ecosystem with Reminders and Calendar:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:6880/1*DSmsRsrESbBNF91djH0BzQ.png)

Regarding the portability principle, in each of these ecosystems there are ways to export your data into standard or otherwise reasonable formats. Interestingly the iCalendar format also supports task lists as well as calendar events. The perfect combination. Unfortunately relatively few applications unify their exports into this one format.

In the spirit of ‚ÄòPrioritizing Portability‚Äô an alternative approach is to keep all of your calendar events in a physical or digital notebook. I personally like setups I‚Äôve seen using Bullet Journals, Cal Newport‚Äôs Time Blocking Journal, and the traditional Franklin Planner. You may just have to modify them to make your lists more front-and-center or easy to place alongside your calendar. For digital notebooks, longtime readers know I‚Äôm a huge fan of Obsidian. I use a combination of the ‚ÄòFull Calendar‚Äô and ‚ÄòKanban‚Äô plugins. For the former, each event is its own file and for the latter I can store multiple lists in a simple markdown file.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:6904/1*vzuyM4u3UI1mvvmOgRC-CA.png)

This approach makes it super easy for me to store data related to my events all in a way that is easy to understand. It is very powerful and I even have a script that performs import and export from and to the iCalendar standard. These were so easy to create with AI tools, that I may take it one step further and augment the actual plugins to work together. I combine this use of my calendar more broadly with Altas Journaling to manage notes on projects and spaces at larger timescales.

# Conclusion

This article has offered a glimpse into a different way of seeing your calendar. My hope is that it shows you a much more inspiring path than simply using your calendar. The changes might seem small at first: you keep a calendar with some lists, and you ‚Äúcolor‚Äù your events and list items based on what you value.

I hope you now see that we might have been using our calendars all backwards. We‚Äôve treated them mainly as places to plan the future, instead of sources of inspiration from our past and reflections of what we truly want to do. We‚Äôre often tempted to let our calendars control us, or we pack them with so many events that we become overwhelmed.

This approach shows you how to use the exact same tools you‚Äôre already familiar with, but to look at them differently. Instead of just focusing on the future, you look at your past events, coloring them by useful categories. You then look at your lists of things to do, which are often shaped by what‚Äôs happening now.

The core idea is to keep your future relatively open. You fill in the details of your immediate future based on what truly resonates from your past. It‚Äôs a very organic and dynamic process where you stay connected to what you‚Äôre doing throughout the day.

Instead of keeping separate journals or logbooks, you can bring all this information together within the tools you already use. You can keep your system as simple as you want, or make it as powerful and personal as you need.

No matter how you set it up, the next time you look at your favorite calendar app, ask yourself:

What have I done that can inspire my future?

What can I draw on from my lists to shape what‚Äôs next?

When seen this way, it does seem simple. But sometimes, the simplest things are the hardest to put into practice, especially when our digital tools promise endless automation for planning our time. My hope is that the ideas in this article help you use your time more freely and in a way that inspires you, rather than just being dictated by your app. üèîÔ∏è
