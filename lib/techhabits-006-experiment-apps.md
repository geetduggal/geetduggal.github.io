And also a quick rule-of thumb on when to .txt, .md, and .csv

üéâÔ∏è Happy new year to you all! Now that I‚Äôve had a few quarters with  [my Bullet Journal](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/your-obsidian-workflow-is-missing-a-physical-notebook-2e99866edcfc), I‚Äôm excited to put together a larger article on that and share it with everyone. Until then, here is a quick summary of a recent  **brain fungus**  I have had. But first:

----------

**brain fun¬∑gus**  | brƒÅn Ààf…ôNG…°…ôs |
noun
an inevitable and mushrooming preoccupation of the mind with something ostensibly unreasonable.  _He let a simple expiration date on a package of shredded cheese turn into a brain fungus on food preservation in general._

origin
circa 2005 after a discussion with roommates concerning the potential of fungus to form on shredded cheese after the expiration date. unlike a  [mind virus](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mind+virus), a brain fungus is generally not highly contagious

----------

Long-time readers may know that I like to  [capture my tasks in Obsidian](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/capture-to-do-d040e1bae4a6)  and eventually  [schedule them on my calendar](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/discipline-absorbs-chaos-try-this-game-changing-simple-way-to-manage-your-time-14e262ca05bc). I have long felt that I may be unreasonable with my stubbornness in capturing tasks in plain text files. The alternative would be to use a standard and high quality task manager such as Reminders, Todoist, or Things.

My recent brain fungus was trying to figure out why, even when actively trying, I can‚Äôt seem to find a better way to manage my tasks than in plain text and often with the assistance of Obsidian. The answer generally comes down to the fact that I have found no better way to  [quickly capture multiple types of media](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/the-most-useful-ios-shortcut-for-obsidian-and-beyond-revisited-9692e62c993a)  in a way that feels smooth and easy to use across many applications. That, and I like to  _play_  with my tasks in 2D and in the context of other contextually relevant text (more on this in the upcoming Bullet Journal article).

But it  _does_  feel like the right time to  [experiment](https://nesslabs.com/book)  with the way I capture my daily notes and tasks  _in plain text_. Specifically motivated by a series of recent posts by  [Ellane W](https://ellanew.com/), I am shortly going to switch my daily logging to one big text file (OBTF) after using separate files for the better part of a decade. Fear not, dates will still be in  [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)  format using the  [correct way to refer to years](https://ellanew.com/ptpl/137-2024.53-write-the-date-right).

Using OBTF for me is largely motivated by the fact that I like the idea that text across days can be relatively close in spatial proximity when editing a file. From an extended working memory perspective, this also spiritually aligns better with the Newportonian  [WorkingMemory.txt](https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/)  approach which has long resonated with me.

Why does it feel like the right time to experiment with a new technique? In the spirit of  [Weather Resistant Productivity](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/weather-resistant-productivity-2a90c4357068), I have determined that this modification to my current workflow will likely only provide the benefits listed above with little-to-know drawback. It‚Äôs a very deliberately chosen ‚Äòshiny new app/technique‚Äô that has been marinating for a while. Because of this, it‚Äôs worth me investing some time into selecting and modifying my tooling and workflows to support my OBTF. This will certainly be the subject of upcoming posts.

----------

-   `.txt`: when your writing is best viewed in a monospaced font
-   `.md` : when you may want even a hint of formatting or additional metadata (eg. indentation in bulleted lists or bold text, or even a  [Kanban view](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/tech-habits-project-management-using-a-csv-file-vs-obsidian-kanban-2560f832d33c)  like in Obsidian Kanban)
-   `.csv`  when you would like to visualize your data like a spreadsheet in a 2D grid

----------

-   I am extremely grateful for the last year and having (re-)discovered Medium as a platform that I can sporadically express/vent/explore my thoughts on tech and ‚Äòproductivity‚Äô (though I really feel that word is weird and awkwardly loaded)
-   [This podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZCUdGlbPhM)  with Kendra Adachi as a guest, for me, hits the nail on the head for the way we should mental model how we plan and pursue our ‚Äòproductivity‚Äô. The message has been in the back of my mind for years and I‚Äôm so glad she can articulate it so well
-   The third app I would be stranded on a desert island with is ‚ÄúYouTube‚Äù. It simultaneously provides me with music (even eg.  [this remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIvQvIEsHZM)  of an Abba song I have had trouble finding on Spotify), podcasts, authentic & engaging videos I can relate to, ambience, a handy offline mode, and even full audiobooks of ‚Äòclassic‚Äô texts. I would choose it over many other reading-related apps simply because I was born with a particularly bad dose of Myopia so I don‚Äôt like to stress my eyes too much reading and prefer audio, video, and text to speech when possible.
-   Also in the spirit of Weather Resistant Productivity, here‚Äôs my  `what works.md`  (not `.txt` !) file at last.

‚ÄòTill next time! üèîÔ∏è
