I recently came across a quote from the  [SOLVED podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b77XuGU52To)  that stuck with me:

> _I think every productive person develops some sort of system for themselves. What people mistake is that that system is not the cause of their productivity, it’s the effect. You learn what your personality is, what your proclivities are, what your emotional pitfalls are, the things that you get anxious about and that you worry about and that you stress about, and the way you like to get things done and the sorts of things you like to do first thing in the morning versus last thing in the afternoon, and you build your own system around that to optimize for yourself._

I agree with this almost entirely, but I’d add one qualification.

The system you build isn’t simply optimized for yourself to serve some external measurement of productivity in the traditional sense.  I’m more convinced that spending a small fraction of time thinking about these systems is really about how you make sense of the world, build and share your own digital homes and universes, and tell the stories of your professional and personal lives in the most meaningful and useful ways.

Productivity, in that framing, serves your own sense of clarity rather than other ostensibly productive goals.

With that, this is a short one. A few things I’ve been experimenting with and thinking about lately.

## Daily Highlights as All Day Events

The idea of a daily highlight isn’t new, but I’ve found that the implementation matters enormously. For me, creating the daily highlight as an all day event in my calendar has been the most effective approach.

Why all day events specifically?

**First, visibility.**  When you open your calendar, all day events sit at the top. They’re not buried in the timeline of meetings and appointments. Your highlight is the first thing you see when you look at your day.

**Second, they don’t compete with time blocks.**  A highlight isn’t necessarily something you do at 9am or 2pm. It’s the through line of the day, the thing you want to be true about today when you look back on it. All day events capture that intention without forcing you to schedule it into a specific slot.

**Third, reflection becomes effortless.**  I recently went through the past few months of my calendar, and I was struck by how much useful information I could quickly collect from my all day event highlights. What was I focused on in October? I could see it at a glance. Which weeks felt scattered versus intentional? The days without highlights stood out as gaps.

The calendar becomes a kind of log, but one that’s immediately visible when you’re planning or reflecting. You don’t have to open a separate journal or notes app.  [The story of your days is already embedded in the tool you use to plan them](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/have-you-been-using-your-calendar-all-wrong-9e686de42237).

I generally regret the days I didn’t get around to creating an all day event highlight. Those days feel like gaps in my own story. I’m looking to be more consistent about this going forward.

## Multiscale Planning with Year Calendars

Through Nick Milo, I came across the concept of a “year calendar” via  [Bird’s Eye Cal](https://birdseyecal.com/). It’s a simple idea: a single view of an entire year, with each day as a small cell.

In the spirit of  [Atlas journaling](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/atlas-journaling-a-unified-approach-for-seeing-the-big-picture-and-acting-with-focus-78804f26f5ab), this gives you the ability to see your daily highlights at a glance across an entire year. You can zoom out and see patterns, seasons, and rhythms rather than just the next week or month. You can ask: what do I want the next quarter to be about? And then you can see whether your daily highlights are actually adding up to that.

This is multiscale planning in practice. The daily highlight connects to the weekly rhythm, which connects to the seasonal arc, which connects to the yearly story. And the all day event is the atomic unit that makes all of it visible.

## A Tiny Experiment: Physical Notes for Daily Highlights

I use my main Bullet Journal primarily for  [Atlas journaling](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/atlas-journaling-a-unified-approach-for-seeing-the-big-picture-and-acting-with-focus-78804f26f5ab)  at the seasonal timescale. But I recently got a pocket Bullet Journal, and I loved the twist that it can work in “portrait mode” with a full A5 page. The grids and quality of the original Bullet Journal are hard to beat.

I’m going to experiment with keeping basic notes related to my daily highlight in physical form (spiritually similar to Carl Pullein’s “keep a physical note beside your computer/phone throughout the day” philosophy). The idea is simple: throughout the day, jot down notes, thoughts, and progress related to my highlight on paper. At the end of the day, take a picture and store it in the digital all day event.

It’s a bridge between the tactile satisfaction of pen and paper and the searchability and permanence of digital storage. The physical act of writing might deepen my engagement with the highlight, while the photo ensures nothing is lost.

We’ll see how it goes. The goal isn’t to add complexity but to find out whether the analog layer adds something valuable to the digital backbone.

## Battle Tested Apps

Finally, a thought I’ll likely expand on in future posts.

Apps and Obsidian plugins are kind of a dime a dozen. But the best ones are battle tested, and that takes time and experience. I’m beginning to appreciate this more deeply.

An analogy: old Fortran modules with numerical solutions for linear algebra problems. LAPACK has been around forever.

Another parallel is the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s concept of  [graduated, incubating, and sandbox projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/). Not everything needs to be cutting edge. Sometimes you want the tool that’s been through the fire.

**Longevity and stability matter.**  When evaluating a new tool, ask yourself: has this been around long enough to prove itself? Is there a community behind it? Will it still work in five years?

I’ll likely be talking about this more in subsequent posts and providing lists of plain text apps and workflows that fit in the “battle tested” or “graduated” category. ‘Till next time 🏔️
