# Tech Habits: The Problem with ‚ÄòTask Batching‚Äô

## Task batching can be an anti-pattern. Plus my path from quick capture in Obsidian to a time-blocked calendar.

The basic idea behind task batching is to collect a bunch of small, related tasks you are obliged to do, and knock them out in a focused block of time.

The argument is that this method will minimize mental strain and avoid the overhead introduced by constantly switching between different kinds of tasks. It is also a practice commonly recommended by productivity experts (eg. Cal Newport, the authors of  _Make Time,_ etc)_._ Examples of task batching include:

-   triage/organize emails
-   process your inbox of notes or ideas on a topic,
-   schedule a bunch of meetings, and
-   run a bunch of errands at places nearby.

While task batching is  _generally_  useful for me, I‚Äôve found it to be problematic at least as often as it‚Äôs helpful. And it‚Äôs not hard to imagine why. For example, two obvious issues with task batching are

-   overhead introduced by ‚Äòkicking the can down the road‚Äô for even very simple tasks, and
-   reduced responsiveness to others.

Most importantly, when I reach the end of a task batching block,  **I feel drained.** So much so, that I literally have to experience a mini ‚Äòrecovery period‚Äô before I‚Äôm motivated to get back to working on anything else.  **Even if the tasks are similar in nature or about the same topic**, I still feel that sense of drain.

This became especially clear to me when I compared it to working out, taking a long walk, or a deep work session. For example, working out also requires discipline and is often done in batches where multiple smaller exercises are grouped together. But after a good workout, I typically feel energized or accomplished. With task batching, particularly for dull or repetitive tasks that align with my larger goals, I rarely get that sense of fulfillment.

In an ironic reversal, the act of task batching may exacerbate the very problem it is trying to solve. For example, if you dedicate a block of time to answer a bunch of emails and chats related to a specific project at work, it may be an efficient way to use your time, but it may not end up adding up to a  _satisfying_  batch  of tasks.

In the end, am I not still context switching between these smaller, but related tasks? Why do I still feel that completing these related set of tasks in one go is just a small consolation for my perceived loss of valuable time? Did I actually just create a block of time  _dedicated_  to context switching between menial tasks related to this project?

I think it‚Äôs healthy to see these menial tasks for the spades they really are, but I am also convinced they don‚Äôt have to be the source of my death by a thousand cuts.

First, it is critical to acknowledge that most tasks aren‚Äôt as small as they seem. Even tasks that appear to be two-minute knockouts can take much longer than expected. Trying to complete many of them in a small fixed block of time can therefore set you up for failure. This is why I find that allotting 15 to 30 minutes for most small tasks, even if it is an overestimate, is more practical than attempting to fit them into a batch.

My current workflow tends to  **favor  _short_ interstitial periods of time between substantial work to quickly process messages sent to me or notes I have quick-captured in Obsidian** (see  [this post](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/the-most-useful-ios-shortcut-for-obsidian-and-beyond-revisited-9692e62c993a)  for how I quick capture notes). For example, if I am waiting in line for a car wash, I may process a few unread chat messages and clear out a few messages from my inbox. I won‚Äôt necessarily clear out the whole thing in one-go, but I have found that enough of these ‚Äòinterstitial‚Äô periods occur throughout the day that I am able to process all my messages fairly effectively. (In the spirit of of Cal Newport‚Äôs ‚Äòshutdown ritual‚Äô I do not feel obliged to process messages or notes after a certain, often later, time during the day.)

**For any given message or note, I determine where it fits into my master project list**  (see  [the last post](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/tech-habits-managing-project-lists-in-plain-text-files-and-obsidian-a51c5e72f5ac)  in the Tech Habits series for more on this). This message or note may be related to an existing project or even warrant the creation of a new one. Because of what I said about task batching earlier, I avoid hiding tasks in projects or batches. Projects in my master list are therefore usually quite fine-grained in nature.

Second, it is critical for me to choose tasks to work on that resonate at multiple levels. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I have found it quite valuable to continue to build on a foundation I have laid in previous writing. My frustration with task batching ties back to a  [trilogy](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/capture-to-do-d040e1bae4a6)  [of](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/satisfy-the-beast-science-the-sh-t-out-of-difficult-tasks-and-habits-18c4e3d2f04a)  [articles](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/discipline-absorbs-chaos-try-this-game-changing-simple-way-to-manage-your-time-14e262ca05bc)  I wrote about task and time management.

In the first article, I emphasized the importance of seizing what resonates with me, particularly when it comes to thinking of small, even menial tasks as a creative act. Repeating and reinforcing these resonant tasks in my mind helps build motivation.

The second article delved into working memory and how certain times of the day are better suited for different types of tasks. I‚Äôve learned that tasks, even simple self-care ones like cleaning the house or washing the clothes, are best completed when my body and mind are aligned.

The third article helps to bring it all together in terms of how I approach my calendar. My  **time-blocked calendar entries are now more thoughtfully chosen. They resonate with what I know will likely be most aligned with me at any particular time**. I usually block off 15 to 30-minute chunks, avoiding tasks like ‚Äúclean out inbox‚Äù or ‚Äúprocess emails,‚Äù which are notorious for being mentally draining.

When organizing my day in the context of other events, each small task is seen meaningful in its own right and not shoved under a proverbial task batch or project rug. Every project name in my master list corresponds directly to the exact same name of one or more events in my calendar. With this more thoughtful approach, even disparate and mundane tasks scattered throughout the day leave me feeling satisfied as opposed to drained.

The key for me: a small amount of upfront work to define the scope of my projects plus thoughtful allocation of time devoted to them eliminates the need to cluster work on related tasks and experience the sometimes unfortunate consequences of batching.

A few housekeeping notes:

-   **Obsidian.**  If I were stranded on a desert island with only four mobile apps, one would (predictably) be Obsidian. Obsidian is indispensable for me primarily because of its powerful, flexible, and efficient mobile interface. Whether for writing or organizing information, Obsidian is a tool that I can count on to keep most all of my important content quickly accessible and organized in one place. Its local file-based system makes it incredibly portable, and it therefore integrates seamlessly with other tools like iOS shortcuts and Modern CSV. The other three apps will be discussed in future Tech Habits posts!
-   **CSV apps.**  I‚Äôve been continuing my experiments with CSV apps, and while I like Modern CSV a lot, its excellent keyboard shortcuts sometimes lead to unanticipated edits. For example, if a row is selected and I start typing, it fills in every column with the same text! I‚Äôm considering trying Easy CSV on Mac, an app I already love on iOS, to see if it‚Äôs a better fit for my workflow.
-   **Future Articles.**  I  _still_ haven‚Äôt forgotten about some of the longer articles I‚Äôve been planning, particularly the third installment of my bullet journaling series, where I‚Äôll explore how physical journals fit into all of these workflows I‚Äôve recently been describing. I‚Äôm also working on making a subset of my ‚Äò[weather resistant productivity](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/2a90c4357068)‚Äô workflow and ‚Äòwhat works‚Äô files publicly accessible on Github soon!
-   **Pointers**. As I‚Äôve explored some automation to my  [personal finance management system](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/the-power-of-obsidian-for-personal-finance-accounting-f00bbcb1b66f), I‚Äôve fallen off the wagon of manual double-entry accounting, and  [Ellane](https://miscellaneplans.medium.com/)‚Äôs recent  [PTPL 125 motivated me](https://miscellaneplans.medium.com/ptpl-125-choosing-between-digital-and-analog-and-a-plain-text-accounting-update-8393e7d188d7)  to revisit manual entry with ‚Äòautomated assistance‚Äô.  [Ev](https://evchapman.medium.com/)‚Äôs post on note review systems really struck a chord with me: just spend quality time with your notes!
