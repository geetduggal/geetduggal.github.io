I’ve written before about  [Atlas Journaling](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/atlas-journaling-a-unified-approach-for-seeing-the-big-picture-and-acting-with-focus-78804f26f5ab): my approach to bridging the analog and digital worlds using the Bullet Journal and Obsidian. That system operates at the level of seasons: big-picture maps, project territories, and the migrations that connect them. It’s about seeing the whole landscape at a glance.

But there’s a layer beneath the seasonal view that I didn’t fully address in that piece. It’s where the daily work actually happens: the Log. And for years, the Log layer had a gap I couldn’t quite close.

The Pocket Bullet Journal just closed it.

In Atlas Journaling, I describe the Log as a kind of working memory — a linear, chronological record of ideas, tasks, screenshots, and quick notes. Digitally, this lives in Obsidian as a stream of daily notes that aren’t fully categorized yet. They’re raw material: inputs waiting to be processed, referenced, or discarded.

What I always wanted was an analog counterpart to that digital log. Something I could reach for in the middle of a conversation, during a walk, or while deep in a coding session without picking up my phone or opening my laptop. Something tactile and immediate that could coexist with the digital without trying to replace it.

The full-sized Bullet Journal was never quite right for this. It’s a beautiful tool for seasonal spreads and the two-dimensional reflection that Atlas Journaling depends on. But it’s not something you carry in your pocket. It lives on a desk or in a backpack. And that meant the daily, in-the-moment layer of my system was always defaulting to my phone with all the friction and distraction that implies.

## The Pocket Bullet Journal

There are plenty of pocket notebooks out there: Field Notes, Leuchtturm pocket editions, Moleskine cahiers. They work well as single purpose notebooks, but otherwise they tend to become either scrap repositories (loose, unconnected jottings with no through-line) or single-purpose artifacts, like a grocery list or a meeting scratch pad.

What Ryder Carroll’s Pocket Bullet Journal does differently is bring structure to pocket note-taking without adding burden. When you open it, you’re greeted with the same grid paper and proportions as the full-sized journal — just compressed to A5 landscape orientation, the size of a traditional Bullet Journal page. The rapid logging system still applies. There’s an index. There’s intention baked into the format.

That structure matters. It’s the difference between a pocket full of scraps and a daily log that actually belongs to a larger system.

## One Page, One Day (Roughly)

The practice I’ve settled into is roughly one page per day, anchored by a daily highlight.

The daily highlight is an idea I’ve carried over from the book  _Make Time_  and refined through Atlas Journaling and [all-day events in my calendar](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/tech-habits-daily-highlights-as-all-day-events-e70d239540ea). Each day, I set a single intention: the one thing I want to accomplish or focus on. At the end of the day, I reflect briefly (sometimes just thirty seconds) on what actually stood out, whether or not it matched my intention. A few words. No full sentences, no overthinking.

In the pocket journal, this highlight anchors the page. Around it, I might jot a rough list of tasks, a sketch, a question I want to think through. Some pages are dense, some are sparse. Sometimes one page covers two days. That’s fine. The point isn’t precision; it’s having a consistent place to return to that asks, “_what am I intentionally doing today?”_

What makes the hybrid system work for me is that the pocket journal is the scaffold, and the digital system is where you get into the weeds.

Say I’m deep in a project: writing code, pulling from documentation, running terminal commands, capturing outputs. All of that belongs in the digital space. Obsidian handles it well. It’s searchable, linkable, and scales with complexity.

But the pocket journal is always there alongside it. When I want to step back and ask, “_what are the two or three things I’m actually trying to accomplish today for this project?” ←_ that’s a pocket journal question. When I need to sketch a rough diagram ← pocket journal. When I want to capture a fleeting thought without disappearing into a screen ← pocket journal.

The physical page engages a different part of the brain. I think it almost goes without saying at this point that researchers have documented how handwriting processes information differently than typing. The practical effect for me is that the journal slows me down just enough to think clearly, while the digital side moves fast. They’re not competing. They’re doing different jobs.

The pocket journal only works as part of a hybrid system if there’s a way to bridge it back to the digital world. My approach is intentionally low-friction: I photograph each page and add it to my digital log in Obsidian. That’s it.

The photo serves two purposes. First, it means I’m not locked out of my notes when I don’t have the journal on me. Second, it creates a natural mirror between the physical and digital logs. The same daily highlight appears in both places, in different forms. Over time, this repetition reinforces what matters.

My Year Linear Calendar Extension to the Obsidian Full Calendar Plugin

But here’s where it gets genuinely useful: I’ve built a  [linear calendar view](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/tech-habits-property-folders-a-linear-calendar-view-in-obsidian-a-plain-text-renaissance-9252bad51a46)into my flattened Johnny Decimal system that displays all my daily notes at a glance. This view shows my highlights directly. They populate as daily entries in a timeline format. And it’s become my default view. I can see the whole year with everything laid out linearly. This connection between the pocket journal and the calendar view is critical because it bridges note-taking with planning and time in a way I hadn’t managed before. When I’m thinking about what to work on next, or reflecting on a week, I’m not hunting through nested folders or flipping through pages. I can see my highlights in sequence, which instantly shows me what’s been engaging me, what patterns are emerging, where my energy has been flowing.

The pocket journal is the daily scaffold. It’s the intimate, tactile place where highlights live. The digital calendar view is the retrieval and planning layer where those captures become visible as part of a larger timeline. Together, they create a system where the daily and the seasonal naturally inform each other.

## Where This Fits in the Larger System

For those familiar with my writing on ALPPS (Archives, Logs, People, Projects, Spaces), the pocket journal lives squarely in the Log layer. It’s not an archive. It’s not a Project tool. It’s a daily companion for the working memory that makes the rest of the system function.

What’s changed is that the Log layer finally has both a digital and an analog home that genuinely belong together. The digital log handles scale, searchability, and integration with the broader Johnny Decimal structure. The pocket journal handles immediacy, reflection, and the slow, tactile thinking that screens don’t support well.

The clearest signal that it’s working is that I reach for the pocket journal without thinking. It’s everyday carry alongside my phone and keys — and unlike my phone, picking it up doesn’t pull me anywhere other than the thing I was already thinking about.

The daily highlight practice has become more consistent than it ever was with the full-sized journal precisely because the pocket format removes the friction of having to be at a desk. The integration with my digital system is lightweight enough that it doesn’t feel like maintenance.

The full-sized Bullet Journal hasn’t gone away. It still handles seasonal spreads, two-dimensional mapping, and the longer reflective work that needs more space. But the pocket journal is where the daily practice actually lives now.

It turned out to be the format I always wanted to keep. I just didn’t know it existed yet.

A few other brief notes:

**Weekly log clearing:**  One idea I’ve borrowed from the  [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/vault)  is the practice of clearing out my digital Log approximately weekly. I take a look at I’ve captured digitally, decide what stays, what migrates to projects or spaces, what just gets let go. This prevents the Log from becoming a graveyard of old notes and keeps it as an active working memory rather than an archive. It’s a natural rhythm that pairs well with the pocket journal

**Screenshots and images as primary capture:**  Over the last year, I’ve shifted toward capturing more via screenshots, photos, and images rather than typed notes. There’s something about how images preserve the actual shape of an idea — the layout, the context, even the emotion of it — that text alone doesn’t. When I screenshot a code block, a design, a passage from a book, I’m capturing  _how my brain actually saw it_, not how I’d transcribe it. For the pocket journal, this means I might paste or sketch something visual rather than transcribing it into words. In the digital system, it means my log is increasingly visual, which makes it faster and more intuitive to scan and retrieve later. IMHO, it’s worth experimenting with this if you’re used to text-only capture.

‘Till next time! 🏔️
