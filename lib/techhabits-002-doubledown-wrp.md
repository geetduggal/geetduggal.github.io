Sometimes I feel like me writing, reading, and thinking about productivity is almost comical. Couldn‚Äôt I just be using this time to ‚Äòdo the thing‚Äô: something  _actually_  productive vs.  _meta_ productive? This thought for me is fleeting these days. Fact: the time I spend thinking about productivity is far less than the time I spend ‚Äòdoing the things‚Äô, but the benefits I derive from thinking about productivity are priceless.

We productivity nerds are an interesting breed. I‚Äôd bet that few of us are actually interested in productivity in the traditional sense (eg. maximizing some form of ostensibly meaningful output linked to our professions). I think we are all trying to answer this kinda question: how can I get my sh*t together in a way that feels right and true to  _me_  in the deepest sense? The answer to this question can vary greatly from person to person, but what we all have in common is a desire to pursue this nagging feeling.

In the last few weeks I‚Äôve had enough stuff thrown my direction from different angles that it made me think harder about a phrase I used when writing about one of my key personal productivity systems: ‚Äúcapture everything in one place‚Äù.

> I argue that, to the extent possible,  _everything_  that resonates should be captured in one primary place as the ‚Äòsource of truth‚Äô. It is then much easier to see these items in the context of all the others and prioritize accordingly.

Something that has been nagging at me lately is that this quote from the article above can be misleading, sometimes even to myself. If my one place to capture everything is my daily log folder, does that imply that such disparate notes:

-   ideas for a vacation itinerary,
-   sentences for this article,
-   grocery lists,
-   administrative tasks for work,
-   an event I need to attend,
-   an alarm I want to set,
-   etc.

_all_  go first to my log? No.

In short (and as discussed in the article), such disparate items  _can_  go into that log, but they can also be placed directly where they need to be if that requires little-to-no friction during capture. To illustrate this with a comically extreme example, if I‚Äôm already in a document working on my vacation itinerary, why would I capture a note about it in my ‚Äúone place‚Äù? There already exists a  _right_  place for it.

However, there should be one place you know you need to go to make sure you‚Äôve properly sorted everything you‚Äôve captured. This place is there so that you can unload what‚Äôs on your mind in the most frictionless way possible without the pressure of having to sort or organize in the moment.

When recently facing a maelstrom of incoming tasks and obligations, I have found it most useful to  _double down_ on the workflows I have previously described. I find great value in treating every uncategorized note as a task that lives in my daily log. In this sense, my ‚Äúone place‚Äù to capture info serves as a sort-of extended working memory to process on the  [scale of days](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/want-extraordinarily-useful-and-timeless-notes-build-a-personal-knowledge-encyclopedia-bc8b7fb09829). It has also been extremely useful as a historical record of these two types of tasks: I may be in the middle of something else and don‚Äôt want to context switch, or it is unclear on where to properly sort the task or thought.

What does this mean in practice?

-   [**Obsidian**](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/capture-to-do-d040e1bae4a6)**.**  Obsidian can be thought of as my primary front-end for my ‚Äúone capture place‚Äù: my daily log. I also use it for project management, and repository of more timeless notes. It is all based on plain text files. I‚Äôm not incredibly dependent on Obsidian. If it went away tomorrow I‚Äôd be sad, but not debilitated in any way.
-   [**Calendar**](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/discipline-absorbs-chaos-try-this-game-changing-simple-way-to-manage-your-time-14e262ca05bc) **(and Alarms).** In the end, everything that‚Äôs important enough to act on needs to end up on my calendar. I try to use naming conventions that match those for tasks and project names that end up in Obsidian.
-   [**Pen & paper**](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/your-obsidian-workflow-is-missing-a-physical-notebook-2e99866edcfc)**.** I‚Äôve found an analog medium to be the most useful for high level organization/vision/planning as well as simple grocery lists. The hardest part here is when it comes to ‚Äúcapturing everything in one place‚Äù. There is an undeniable tension between pulling my phone out to drop down a quick note or use a physical notebook on my person. This is where ‚Äòdoubling down‚Äô comes in again. A physical notebook for a simple grocery list or seasonal planning maybe the final destination and often be the most useful place to capture a thought if it doesn‚Äôt introduce any additional friction. However, if I do find myself most comfortable taking a physical note in any given context, and the friction is too high to properly organize this note, I simply take a photo of the note and use  [my iOS shortcut](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/the-most-useful-ios-shortcut-for-obsidian-and-beyond-revisited-9692e62c993a)  to quickly capture the image to my daily log for subsequent processing. I‚Äôve always been a bit bullish on digital solutions even in the early 90s when it wasn‚Äôt yet mainstream to capture virtually everything digitally. Coming from that end makes me appreciate the physical medium that much more.
-   [**Vi**](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/tech-habits-obsidian-live-preview-vi-focus-mode-alarms-for-calendar-events-8c42976be5af)**.** As hinted in the inaugural post on this ‚Äòtech habits‚Äô series as well as a recent article I wrote on ‚Äú[weather resistant productivity](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/weather-resistant-productivity-2a90c4357068)‚Äù, I have also found great value in double downing on a simple terminal based text editor called Vi. Explicitly encoding my commitment to this editor has helped me to embed a few more editing tips and tricks into my long-term memory, and I don‚Äôt second-guess what editor to open by default for writing or coding that is relatively deep. I can‚Äôt use this tool everywhere I am and there‚Äôs no really good mobile experience for it, which is why Obsidian has been a necessary complement for me.

‚ÄòDouble downing‚Äô in this context doesn‚Äôt just mean a deeper commitment to the specific tools and workflows I have discussed above. It also means that these workflows in some cases would be  _even more powerful and useful_ if they were more constraining and more opinionated. This mentality helps me to avoid indecision on where to capture particular item of interest or what tool to use in any given context. In the spirit of weather resistant productivity, this doesn‚Äôt mean that these workflows are immutable. It just means I need to be more precise about them and thoughtful about changes to them to handle what life throws at me.

Some other quick notes:

-   I also mentioned in my ‚ÄúCapture to Do‚Äù article that I like prefixing certain file names and directories with emojis. This proved to be a bit cumbersome when browsing files in a terminal or referring to them by full path names in other applications like iOS Shortcuts, so I have since abandoned these emoji. I am looking into Obsidian‚Äôs ‚Äòiconize‚Äô plugin to enjoy the visual benefits of icons without disturbing my file and folder names.
-   Somewhat related to emoji ‚òïÔ∏è, see also  [Elanne‚Äôs excellent PTPL 122](https://medium.com/@miscellaneplans/aligning-your-task-list-with-the-values-all-humans-share-88b59cd56462). I particularly like the ‚Äòvalues all humans share‚Äô sentiment and was surprised (and now not) to find that I independently maintain a shockingly similar list to Carl Pullein and Shalom H. Schwartz.
-   **Thought experiment.**  if you were stranded on a desert island but were given a choice to have only 4 apps on your phone (in addition to basic phone functionality, messaging/emailing and web browsing), what would they be? In the next post in this series I will share mine! üì≤
-   **Upcoming.**  I‚Äôm becoming increasingly interested in working memory and how it relates to our relationship with technology and productivity (see ‚Äò[Satisfy the Beast](https://medium.com/@geetduggal/satisfy-the-beast-science-the-sh-t-out-of-difficult-tasks-and-habits-18c4e3d2f04a)‚Äô for an intro to my interest in this topic). More on that soon (likely after I read  _Why We Remember_). Also, I have not forgotten about sharing my third installment of Bullet Journaling! I will also share publicly a decent chunk of workflows for weather resistant productivity on my Github account. My hope is that sharing this text file it is a useful way for anyone to see even more concrete examples of how these workflows look and, for me, a way to publicly commit to them and see how they change.
-   **Analog tidbit.**  I think it‚Äôs time for a showdown between the Uniball Micro Deluxe edition and Pentel Energel (both 0.5mm) pens. Both are excellent options that are easily available and replaceable and have a smooth writing experience. But I want to choose a favorite.

‚ÄòTill next time! üèîÔ∏è
